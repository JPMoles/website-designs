# 10 Days of Website Designs

Everyday, for ten sequential days, I will create a one-page website with a new or interesting design. This is intended to help me practice css and a couple of css frameworks.

I may not finish a complete site everyday, but I will learn to work with new web technologies and broaden my understanding of front-end development.
